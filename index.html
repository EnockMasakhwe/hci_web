        <p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol, founded in 1902, has grown into one of the world's most successful and iconic football clubs. <br> Initially dominant in Spain, Real Madrid rose to international prominence in the 1950s, winning the inaugural European Cup and five consecutive titles. <br>Led by legends like Alfredo Di Stéfano, they established themselves as a powerhouse in European football.</p>

            <p>In subsequent decades, Real Madrid experienced highs and lows but maintained a formidable presence both domestically and internationally. <br>The early 2000s saw the "Galácticos" era under Florentino Pérez, with high-profile signings and renewed success. <br> The club's Santiago Bernabéu Stadium has been their iconic home since 1947.</p>
            
           <p> Real Madrid's trophy cabinet includes 34 La Liga titles, 19 Copa del Rey titles, and a record 13 UEFA Champions League/European Cup victories as of 2024. <br> Throughout its history, the club has embodied a commitment to excellence, consistently attracting top talent and achieving remarkable success on the global stage. </p>
